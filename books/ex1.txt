1)  In comparison with a database this book provides means to read information,
    wich can be tracked through summary/index. What is missing is the ability
    to Update, Create and Delete values.
    This book also provides a greate portability, ease of use and low price

2)  We can fetch throught the content by index, in wich we can see what topics
    we talk about in what pages they are. We can also use the word index in wich
    we can get the page by knowing the term name.

3)  CRUD stands for:
        Create:
              The ability to create new data to the database;
        Read:
              The ability to fetch and get all the data that has been in the
              database;
        Update:
              The ability to change some data and update the database so the
              new updated data can also be read;
        Delete:
              The ability to delete data;

4)  A chalkboard provides the full CRUD features, but it almost have no portability, 
    as you can't walk with a chalkboard on your pocket to consult whenever you want.
    It's worthwhile to talk about the security, that on the chalkboard database data
    can be easely corrupted;

5)  It compares by the fact that you can fetch data by creating a index, it's a good
    approach but as the database gets bigger more time will be consumed to return
    simple data;

6)  ACID stants for:
    Atomicity:
      Every task should be finished in order to data be release to other users or task.
      Wich means that every task have their on protected enviroment, like when you write
      down some data in a notebook, nobody should have access while you are doing the task;

    Consistency:
      Consistency is the property that grants data to be right along the database, where
      unfinished requests shouldn't interfer with the datebase and by that eleminate errors
      that may happen during the processing of the work to be done;

    Isolation:
      In order to have consistency we need that the data involved in the resquest be outside
      the access from other users or services until the task in complete;
    
    Durability:
      We need to provide backup and means to grant the life of data according to the needs

7) Cindy transfers 25 to Alice and 50 to Bob
   Alice transfers 125 to Bob
   Bob transfers 150 Cindy
